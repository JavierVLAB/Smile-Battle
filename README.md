In this video we will be setting up real time face detection through a webcam using AI. This AI is so quick that we are able to draw in real time the various faces and expressions of every person in the video without much performance overhead. We will be using the Face API JS library built on Tensor Flow to setup the face detection.

By the end of this video you will have fully functional real time face detection on your site which can be used with any webcam or phone camera. If you want to see a part two of this video make sure to let me know in the comments below.

# IMPORTANT: Bug Fixes

## `navigator.getUserMedia`

`navigator.getUserMedia` is now deprecated and is replaced by `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`. To fix this bug replace all versions of `navigator.getUserMedia` with `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`

## Low-end Devices Bug

The video eventListener for `play` fires up too early on low-end machines, before the video is fully loaded, which causes errors to pop up from the Face API and terminates the script (tested on Debian [Firefox] and Windows [Chrome, Firefox]). Replaced by `playing` event, which fires up when the media has enough data to start playing.
